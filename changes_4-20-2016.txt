--delete data completely upon deleting column 
--system does not need to upload the class pdfs on resources folder anymore ... to avoid acquiring more space on server storage
--yet system has upload error checking... now can upload same subjs of different module(lab/lec)
--remove some tables in sql (reimport sql if using locally)
--hostname 'pupx.dx' changed to 'pupocr.com'
